# DNS service

This plugin provides a DNS service for Sunbeam. It's based on [Designate](https://docs.openstack.org/designate/latest/), a DNS service for OpenStack and Bind.

## Installation

To enable the DNS service, you need an already bootstraped Sunbeam instance. Then, you can install the plugin with:

```bash
sunbeam enable dns --nameservers="<ns records>"
```

## Contents

This plugin will install the following services:
- Bind: a DNS server [charm](https://opendev.org/openstack/charm-bind-k8s) [ROCK](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-docker-images/ubuntu-docker-images/+git/bind9)
- Designate: a DNS service for OpenStack [charm](https://opendev.org/openstack/charm-designate-k8s) [ROCK](https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-openstack-rocks/tree/main/rocks/designate-consolidated)

- MySQL Instance in the case of a multi-mysql installation (for large deployments) [charm](https://github.com/canonical/mysql-k8s-operator) [ROCK](https://github.com/canonical/charmed-mysql-rock)

Services are constituted of charms, i.e. operator code, and ROCKs, the corresponding OCI images.
